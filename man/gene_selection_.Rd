\arguments{
\item{full_data}{Input matrix whose columns correspond to the patients and
rows to the genes.}

\item{survival_time}{Numerical vector of the same length as the number of
columns of \code{full_data}. In addition, the patients must be in the same
order as in \code{full_data}. For the patients whose sample is pathological
should be indicated the time between the disease diagnosis and event
(death, relapse or other). If the event has not occurred, it should be
indicated the time until the end of follow-up. Patients whose sample is
from healthy tissue must have an NA value}

\item{survival_event}{Numerical vector of the same length as the number of
columns of \code{full_data}. Patients must be in the same order as in
\code{full_data}. For the the patients with pathological sample should
be indicated whether the event has occurred (1) or not (0). Only these
values are valid and healthy patients must have an NA value.}

\item{control_tag_cases}{Numeric vector with the indices of the columns
corresponding to the healthy sample patients.}

\item{gen_select_type}{Option. Options on how to select the genes to be
used in the mapper. Select the "Abs" option, which means that the
genes with the highest absolute value are chosen, or the
"Top_Bot" option, which means that half of the selected
genes are those with the highest value (positive value, i.e.
worst survival prognosis) and the other half are those with the
lowest value (negative value, i.e. best prognosis). "Top_Bot" default option.}

\item{num_gen_select}{Number of genes to be selected to be used in mapper.}

\item{matrix_disease_component}{Optional, only necessary in case of gene
selection after dsga has been performed. Matrix of the disease components
(the transformed \code{full_data} matrix from which the normal component has
been removed) from the \code{dsga_function}.}
}
\value{
A \code{gene_selection_object}. It contains:
\itemize{
\item the matrix with which the gene selection has been performed without NAN's
values (\code{data}). It is the \code{matrix_disease_component} in case it has been
performed from a \code{dsga_object} or \code{full_data} in the opposite case.
\item the \code{cox_all_matrix} (a matrix with the results of the application of
proportional hazard models: with the regression coefficients, the odds ratios,
the standard errors of each coefficient, the Z values (coef/se_coef) and
the p-values for each Z value)
\item a vector with the name of the selected genes
\item the matrix of disease components with only the rows of the selected genes
(\code{genes_disease_component})
\item and the vector of the values of the filter function.
