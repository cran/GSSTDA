\usage{
get_mu_beta(bet)
}
\arguments{
\item{bet}{Beta value. Aspect ratio of the input matrix, \deqn{\frac{m}{n}},
were m is the number of rows of the input matrix and n the number of columns.}
}
\value{
It returns the mu beta value. This is the upper limit of integration
where the Marcenko-Pastur distribution is equal to 1/2.
}
\description{
This function identifies the upper bound of integration of the
Marcenko-Pastur distribution, as described in "The Optimal Hard
Threshold for Singular Values is \eqn{\sqrt(4/ 3)}". It explores 100
values in a given interval. Then it selects the values closest to 1/2
on the left and on the right. As the upper bound of integration,
if the distance between the left and right approximations is lower than
a given threshold (1e-10), it converges and the upper bound that produces
an area of 1/2 is defined as the mean of the left and right approximations.
