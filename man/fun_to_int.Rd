\title{Marcenko-Pastur distribution to integrate.}
\usage{
fun_to_int(t, bet)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Parameter t.}

\item{bet}{Beta value. Aspect ratio of the input matrix,
\eqn{\frac{m}{n}}, were m is the number of rows of the input
matrix and n the number of columns.}
}
\value{
It returns the function value for a specific t and a particular
aspect ration m/n.
}
\description{
This function is an auxiliary function that includes
the Marcenco-Pastur function that has to be integrated to find the
upper bound of integration that produces and area of 1/2.
