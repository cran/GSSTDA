\usage{
lp_norm_k_powers_surv(genes_disease_component, p, k, cox_all_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes_disease_component}{Disease component matrix (output of the function of
\code{generate_disease_component}), after having selected the rows
corresponding to the selected genes.}

\item{p}{integer. It indicates the p norm to be calculated.
If k = 1 and p = 2, the function computes the standard
(Euclidean) vector magnitude of each column. For larger values of p the
weight of genes with larger levels is greater.}

\item{k}{integer. Powers of the vector magnitude. If k = 1 and p = 2,
the function computes the standard (Euclidean) vector magnitude
of each column.}

\item{cox_all_matrix}{A matrix with the output of the
\code{cox_all_genes} function that stores the information of all cox
proportional hazard model tests for each gene in the dataset.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector including the values produced by the function
for each sample in the dataset.
}
\description{
A filtering function for mapper that projects $$R$^n$ into $R$.
It calculates for each column of the matrix (each patient), its value
of the filtering function. Specifically, it computes
the vector magnitude in the Lp norm (as well
as k powers of this magnitude) of the vector resulting of
weighting each element of the column vector by the Z score obtained
by fitting a cox proportional hazard model to the level of each gene.
