#' Gene expression matrix
#'
#' Matrix containing gene expression profiling of 104 breast cancer and
#' 17 normal breast biopsies. Expression profiling data by array
#'   (platform HG-U133_Plus_2).
#'
#' @name full_data
#' @format Gene expression matrix with  4165 rows and 121 columns.
#' \describe{The columns correspond to the patients and the rows to
#'   the genes. The column names correspond to the patient identifier
#'   in GEO. The row names correspond to the gene names.
#' }
#' @source The data are from the study GSE42568 available in
#' \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE42568}.
#' The data were processed as explained in the \code{details} section.
#' @details
#' Normalized gene expression data GSE42568. Background correction,
#' summarization, and quantile normalization were carried out using the
#' fRMA method implemented in the \code{fRMA} package. Filtered probes that did
#' not target genes with valid gene id were filtered and  those probes
#' targeting the same gene were collapse by thanking those presenting the
#' highest row variance using the \code{WGCNA::collapseRows} function.
#' Subsequently, due to CRAN publication requirements, the number of genes
#' is randomly reduced to 4165 genes.
